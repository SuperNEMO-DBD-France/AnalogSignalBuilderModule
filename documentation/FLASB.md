Introduction to Analog Signal Builder Module {#usingflasb_intro}
============================================

The Analog  Signal Builder  (ASB) Falaise module  aims to  process the
truth hits generated by  the SuperNEMO simulation program (flsimulate)
and stored in the `SD` bank of the simulated event record, in order to
modelize  the analog  response  of  the detector  in  terms of  signal
waveforms  with a  realistic shape  and amplitude,  including possible
pile-up effects, noisy baselines.  The characteristics of the computed
modeled analog  signals are  stored in  a new  bank, namely  `SSD` for
further use by the digitization module.

The  figure below  illustrates the  workflow of  the ASB  module.  The
module embeds  a collection of  analog signal generator  drivers which
are responsible to build the analog  signal models from the truth hits
provided by  the simulation  program.  The library  implements several
signal  generator  drivers  specialized for  different  categories  of
detectors and contexts:  signal from optical module  hits, signal from
geiger drift cells...
